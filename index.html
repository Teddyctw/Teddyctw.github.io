  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <p>Hi! I'm Tingwei, a PhD student at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), where I work with Prof. Min Xu on AI for wireless sensing.</p>

  <p>Before joining UTS, I completed my Master's degree at CUHK-Shenzhen (2021-2023) and later spent time as a Visiting Student at the Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data (2023-2025), exploring Wi-Fi sensing. Along the way, I also had the chance to work as a Research Intern at Huawei's 2012 Labs, where I worked on Wi-Fi 8 protocol pre-research.</p>

  <p>My research interests lie in mmWave sensing, Wi-Fi sensing and Large Language Model applications, and I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with AI.</p>

  <p>Outside of research, I enjoy playing basketball and volleyball.</p>

  <p>Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about collaboration or just say hello!</p>
