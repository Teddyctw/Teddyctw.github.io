Hi! I’m ​​Tingwei​​, a PhD student at the ​​University of Technology Sydney (UTS)​​, where I work with Prof. Min Xu on ​​AI for wireless sensing​​.

Before joining UTS, I completed my ​​Master’s degree at CUHK-Shenzhen (2021.9–2023.10)​​ and later spent time as a ​​Visiting Student​​ at the ​​Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data (2023–2025)​​, exploring ​​[相关研究兴趣/项目]​​. Along the way, I also had the chance to work as a ​​Research Intern at Huawei’s 2012 Labs​​, where I ​​worked on Wi-Fi 8 protocol pre-research.

My research interests lie in ​​mmWave sensing, Wi-Fi sensing and Large Language Model applications, and I’m passionate about ​​solving real-world problems with AI.

Outside of research, I enjoy ​​playing basketball, volleyball .

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat about collobration​​ or just say hello!
